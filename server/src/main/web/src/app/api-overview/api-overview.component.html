				This pages describes how to quickly start using STAPI, without caring much for contracts. If you plan on integrating STAPI
				into a larger codebase, it would be best to use contracts to generate your client, or to use one of the existing
				<a href="https://github.com/cezarykluczynski/stapi/wiki/Clients">clients</a>.
			</p>
			<h3>Limits</h3>
			<p>
				While the API can be freely used, it's usage is limited to 250 requests per hour per IP. In the beginning of every hour,
				every IP gets a fresh 250 hits to use. Authenticated users get limits of 10000 request per hour per API key, with up to 5 API keys.
			</p>
			<p>
				One search, as well as retrieval of a single entity, are both counted as a single hit.
			</p>
			<p>
				API keys can be obtained in <a routerLink="/panel">panel</a> after successful authentication.
			</p>

			<h3>API layout</h3>
			<p>For people just wanting to quick jump into using STAPI, REST version is the best choice.
				Every entity in the API has two REST endpoints, one for searching and one for retrieving an entire entity, along with it's satellites.
				Available entities are listed on <a href="http://stapi.co/api/">this page</a> on the bottom,
				in <em>Available RESTful services</em> section.
			</p>

			<h3>Example requests</h3>
			<h4>Listing</h4>
			<p>
				Take, for example, the Season entity. To get all seasons, one should call this URL:
				<a href="http://stapi.co/api/v1/rest/season/search">http://stapi.co/api/v1/rest/season/search</a>.
			</p>

			<h4>Searching</h4>
			<p>
				Similar to listing entities, sending POST request to the same URL,
				<a href="http://stapi.co/api/v1/rest/season/search">http://stapi.co/api/v1/rest/season/search</a>,
				allows searching for entities using predefined criteria. Criteria that can be used for searching can be found in
				<a routerLink="/api-documentation">API documentation</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				When searching STAPI, remember to send POST requests as <strong>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</strong>.
			</p>

			<h4>Single entity</h4>
			<p>Single entities can also be retrieved, using previously obtained UID. After searching for seasons, you will find that season one
				of The Next Generation happens to have UID SAMA0000001633 (entity UID's rarely change over time).
				So another call to the API renders details about this season, as well as all episodes from this season:
				<a href="http://stapi.co/api/v1/rest/season?uid=SAMA0000001633">http://stapi.co/api/v1/rest/season?uid=SAMA0000001633</a>.
